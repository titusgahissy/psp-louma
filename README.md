Hello XXXX Team,

I represent a licensed e-commerce company operating nationwide in the Central African Republic.

We are currently building a regulated prepaid payment platform designed primarily for travelers and diaspora users. 
The platform enables users to top up a wallet using international debit cards, with domestic settlement handled locally through mobile money operators and bank rails.

We would like to understand whether your platform supports cross border card acquisition for prepaid wallet top ups, and whether funds acquired via card can be transferred to a mobile money wallet or a local bank account.

Could you please let us know if this use case is supported, and if so, what the onboarding requirements and technical integration process would look like.

Thank you for your time and guidance. 
I look forward to your response.

Regards
